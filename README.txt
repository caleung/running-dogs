COMP 20	

I was able to cover the entire body of the web browser with the omfgdogs gif.  The song plays on the page load in Chrome and Safari.  It repeats on a loop.  The link to the original website is in the bottom-right corner.
I was able to change the url color to green when unvisited and red when visited.  I changed the font to "Lucida Console" with Verdana as a 2nd choice and the size to xx-large.

The only thing I couldn't get to work was the song in Firefox.  According to the Piazza question, we're going to talk about this on Thursday.

I didn't work with any other live people, but I used www.w3schools.com to look up CSS properties and audio tags.

I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
